The backup client should be able to construct snapshot of each of his filesystems.
The snapshot is build in Xomti_Backup_Client_Snapshot databases.
It can discard some files or directories of the filesystem, e.g. temporary or super-secret files.

##############################################
# Xomti_Backup_Client_Snapshot-0.2 databases #
##############################################

There are 5 tables: links, dirs, files, dircontents, and inodes.

All these tables are key/value btree Berkeley DB.
  links, dirs, and files are unique key tables.
  dircontents and inodes are dup keys table.

  #########
  # links #
  #########

key   = full path string
          ex: "/usr/src/kernel-headers-2.6.10-1-686/include/linux/umem.h"
value = 4-elements list {mtime inode type link}
        mtime = modification time (decimal string, as given by Tcl command "file mtime ...")
        inode = inode of this link (decimal string, in order to detect hard links)
        type  = type of linked file
                  file, dir, unknown
        link  = string of linked file

  ########
  # dirs #
  ########

key   = full path string
           ex: "/usr/share/locale"
value = 5-elements list {mtime inode owner group perms}
        mtime = modification time (decimal string, as given by Tcl command "file mtime ...")
        inode = inode of this dir (decimal string)
        owner = owner (ascii string)
        group = group (ascii string)
        perms = permission (octal string)

  #########
  # files #
  #########

key   = 2 or 3-elements list {md5sum snaptime} of {md5sum snaptime #order}
        md5sum   = md5sum of file content (lowercase 32 characters hexadecimal string)
        snaptime = time of snapshot (seconds since the epoch)
        #order   = #1, #2, etc. (eventually constructed in order to have unique key)
value = 8-elements list {size mtime inode root tail owner group perms}
        size  = file size on bytes (decimal string)
        mtime = modification time (decimal string, as given by Tcl command "file mtime ...")
        inode = inode of this file (decimal string, in order to detect hard links)
        root  = full path of directory
        tail  = name of file in his directory
        owner = owner (ascii string)
        group = group (ascii string)
        perms = permission (octal string)
        
  ###############
  # dircontents #
  ###############

key   = full path string
           ex: "/usr/share/locale"
        This is a dup key, identical to "dirs" database key
value = 2-elements list {type ref}
        type = type of file (file, dir, or link)
        ref  = depends on "type" value
               dir  -> full path string, "dirs" database key
               file -> {md5sum snaptime [#order]}, "files" database key
               link -> full path string, "links" database key

  ##########
  # inodes #
  ##########

key   = inode (decimal string). Multiple key is sign of hard links.
value = as for "dircontents" table
