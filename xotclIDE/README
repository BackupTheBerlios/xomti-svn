0.73-fp/    Is the current Artur version with some of my enhancements.
            I will be glad if you test it.
	    Warning, it is a test code, given for experimental purpose,
            without any warranty.

trunk/      Incorporates my last changes.
            Highly experimental, not to be used.

trunk-0.72/ Previous experimental "trunk/"
            To be avoided.
