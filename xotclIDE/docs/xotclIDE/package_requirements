Suppose I have worked on two packages, under subversion control:

  myPackageA/tags/3.2/myPackageA.xotcl
  myPackageB/tags/2.1/myPackageB.xotcl

with "myPackageB 2.1" requiring "myPackageA 3.2".
I begin to develop, requiring "myPackageA 3.2" and some external packages

  myPackageC/trunk/myPackageC.xotcl

What should be loaded in xotclIDE ?

  xotclIDE and external packages, read-only
  "myPackageA 3.2", read-only
  "myPackageC 0.1", read-write

Now, I see that I need to write a new, enhanced version of myPackageA
in order to fulfill myPackageC requirements. How to do ?
I do a svn copy of "myPackageA 3.2" as

  myPackageA/trunk/myPackageA.xotcl

using "svn copy myPackageA/tags/3.2 myPackageA/trunk".
Then I change code and version to 4.0. When code based on

  myPackageA/trunk/myPackageA.xotcl (4.0)
  myPackageC/trunk/myPackageC.xotcl (0.1)

works well, I tag them as new files

  myPackageA/tags/4.0/myPackageA.xotcl
  myPackageC/tags/0.1/myPackageC.xotcl

using "svn move myPackageA/trunk myPackageA/tags/4.0"
and   "svn move myPackageB/trunk myPackageB/tags/0.1"

Later, I want to work on code using "myPackageB 2.1". Then I have to load also

  myPackageA/tags/3.2/myPackageA.xotcl

If I want to work on code using "myPackageC 0.1", I have to load newer version
  
  myPackageA/tags/4.0/myPackageA.xotcl

Of course, if I have time, I will upgrade "myPackageB" to version 2.2,
in order to use "myPackageA 4.0" instead of "myPackageA 3.2",
but before that, it's essential that xotclIDE loads exactly what package
I need, and saves only data marked as write, in package/trunk directories.

Writing package/tags/_version_ directory_ will be done
by "svn move trunk tags/_version_ directory_".
