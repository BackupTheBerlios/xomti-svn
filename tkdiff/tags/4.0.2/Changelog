4.0.2 changes (11/08/2004):

     * better tolerance of Windows filenames
     * CDE, Windows, and MacOSX aware

3.09 changes (5/24/2001):

    * Removed use of the user name in temp file path. This removed a problem
      on Windows when the user name had a space in it.
    * Made diff "edge detection" smarter by using the new smarter overlap code
      for cases where diff decided to treat whitespace slightly different
      on missing-EOL files when doing 3-way diffs.
    * Added the "..." back to the Save options in the merge result window
      when appropriate.

3.08 changes (1/15/2001):

    * Made overlap detection smarter

3.07 changes (12/17/2000):

    * Highlight overlaps in bright yellow during 3-way merge
    * Added "Exit" and "Save & Exit" buttons to merge preview window
    * Removed error that popped up when doing a merge that was
      not necessary.

3.06 changes (unreleased):

    * Minor changes for AccuRev integration

3.05 changes (11/30/1999):

    * Added Jean-Francois' 3-way diff/merge feature
    * Added Bryan Oakley's tabstop feature
    * Added full support for Accurev

3.04 changes (8/5/1999):

    * Basic support for AccuRev. Graphical equivalent of
      'accurev diff foo.c'
    * Fixes as a result of running Scriptics' error
      checker (see archives for details)
    * 'q' is quit

3.03m changes:

    * Added -o <output file> to set the name of the merge
      output file
 
3.03 changes:

    * includes the new line-by-line comparison window
    * bug fix for line numbers not being sync'd initially
    * slight modification for how change bars are colored
    * bug fix for up/down arrow keys (they were moving by
      two lines instead of one)
    * bug fix for Alt-V not opening the View menu (ditto
      for a few other alt- combinations)
    * fixed a couple of -underline options for menus
    * new preferences for enabling the display of the 
      line comparison window, and for configuring how 
      individual characters are highlighted in that window
    * added "<file> vs. <file>" to the window title 
      (eg: foo-old.txt vs. foo.txt - TkDiff 3.03) -- this 
      more closely aligns with Windows standards, and is
      equally useful on other platforms, I suppose
    * online help has been updated to reflect these changes

        + As of 3.00: (11/06/1998)
                A new GUI.
                No more reliance on perl...  It's 100% Tcl/Tk now.
                Built-in editor.
                A "find" facility.
                Lots more...  And all of this thanks to Bryan Oakley!

        + GPL'ed (as of 2.03).

        + RCS, CVS and SCCS support (auto-detected)...  Even more SCM
          systems are supported in 3.00.

        + Highlighted difference regions, randomly accessible, with a
          quick overview/navigation bar.

        + Side-by-side viewing and linked (synchronized) scrolling of files.

        + On-line help and extensive customization (also much-improved in
          3.00).

        + File-merge and change-summary facilities.

        + Line-number toggling (for easier cut & paste), with extra goodies
          as of 3.00.

        + Windows NT support.

...and more stuff I can't even remember, probably.

Much work has been done by Bryan Oakley for this release (in fact, 99%
of it). :-)  Thanks, Bryan!  Keep an eye on the tkdiff home page at
http://www.ipass.net/~klassa/tkdiff for developments...  I don't think
there'll be many, at this point -- Bryan has turned this thing into just
about all you could ask for!  If you have problems, though, please send
bug reports (better yet, patches :-)) against 3.00 to klassa@ipass.net.
